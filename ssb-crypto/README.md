# ssb-crypto

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/ssb-crypto/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/ssb-crypto)

This currently just re-exports the parts of the `sodiumoxide` crate that
are needed by SSB, and defines a couple custom structs.

Some of the exposed types (eg. PublicKey, SecretKey) should ultimately
be wrapped in a higher-level abstraction, like `ssb-multiformats`.
